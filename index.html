        <h1> The site with stuff on it </h1>

        <p> Yeah, not really sure what I'm doing here yet, but going to make stuff. Hopefully good stuff, stuff that makes you think "That was good stuff" </p>
        <br>
        <p> The name of the site comes from George E.P. Box and a quote from him “All models are wrong, but some are useful”. --George E. P. Box. I decided to take this and run with it. Most of the models I use here will be wrong. Probably all of them, if one is right it was probably luck. But we can still figue out some intersting things from these models, making them at last useful. </p>
        <br>
        <p> The other thing I want is for people to at least understand what the model is doing, at least at a high level. No need to understand the code or math, but at least what the idea behing it is. I might also go into a deep dive into some of the wrongness of the model and some of the stuff I do for the analysis. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> Well that's a lot of hopes for a site with almost nothing in it. I'll probably figure it out as I go. <a href="/AllStuff.html">Click here</a> to see all the posts or <a href="/ImmortalDrug_Part1">here</a> to go to the Immortal Drug part 1 post (the only post currently here)</p>

        <p> If this somehow made you want to send me money, you can send it <a href="https://www.patreon.com/wrongmodel">here</a>.  </p>
